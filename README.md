# Predicting-Cancer-Mortality-Rates-Across-the-U.S.

Background & Data
Cancer mortality continues to pose a significant public health challenge despite advancements in medical treatments. 
This study aims to investigate how socioeconomic factors (such as median income and poverty rates), healthcare 
coverage types, and demographic characteristics influence the target death rate due to cancer across different 
regions. This project focuses on predicting cancer mortality rates across the United States by leveraging various 
demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related data. We processed and analyzed two datasetsâ€”Cancer Data (3047 
entries with 33 columns) and Household Data (3220 entries with 4 columns), merging them into a unified dataset of 
size 3047 x 39. Using advanced regression models and feature importance analysis, we identified the most influential 
factors contributing to cancer death rates. The best-performing model, Random Forest, provided insights into the 
relationships between educational attainment, incidence rates, and cancer mortality.
